üåü Key Features
=============
* `Real-Time 3D T-Shirt Customization:`
Experience a fully interactive 3D model of a t-shirt, rendered using Three.js. Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the t-shirt from various angles to ensure their design looks perfect from every perspective.
* `Color Customization:`
Users can personalize the t-shirt‚Äôs color using an intuitive color picker. With a wide range of colors available, users can match their t-shirt to their favorite shades or branding guidelines.
* `Logo Upload Functionality:`
The application allows users to upload custom logos or images through a file picker. Once uploaded, the logo can be placed on the t-shirt, giving users full control over its positioning and size.
* `AI-Powered Logo Generation:`
Users can generate unique logos using an AI prompt system. By providing a text prompt, the AI generates a design based on user input, offering endless creative possibilities.
* `Custom Display Toggles:` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * `Logo Toggle:` Users can switch the logo‚Äôs visibility on and off to decide if it complements the t-shirt design.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * `Full-T-Shirt Toggle:` This option allows users to preview how the logo would look if applied as a full t-shirt pattern, rather than a single image.
* `Save Feature:`
Users can save their customized t-shirt designs with a simple click. This feature ensures that users can revisit their creations later or share them with others.
